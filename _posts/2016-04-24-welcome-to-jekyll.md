I'm migrating the site to be powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). I'm not even sure "powered by" is the right way to put it - maybe more like "prepared with" or "updated with".

Basically, the site will be served as static files now. It's getting moved off my own home-grown blog engine (which wasn't easy to write updates on) and on to something more prolific. Hopefully that will encourage more frequent updates - though I'm sure you've read that before ;)
