I've heard "Code Ownership" referred to quite a bit in my career, but never
actually talked *about* it - not directly, at least not any way pertinent to my
employment.

Pretty early on I decided Code Ownership was a myth. What sensible, competitive,
profit-motivated business would grant ownership of their code base - indeed,
their very product - to their engineering team?! No, the concept of Code
Ownership must be just another one of the recruiting platitudes used to entice
Millennial developers.

I've recently come to understand the concept of Code Ownership in a new light.

Code Ownership doesn't have anything to do with actual ownership of code. It's
more about responsibility and the understanding that the designated "owner" is
going to look after the code's well-being (it's readable, testable, performant,
useful, and complete). The business organization actually owns the code. The
engineer is its caretaker.

In this light, I suggest referring to this faux "Code Ownership" as Code
Stewardship.

## Code Ownership vs Code Stewardship

Code Ownership certainly has a nice ring to it. It sounds absolute, concrete,
and powerful. The reality is far from that. The demands of the business dictate
what features of the product need attention, and by extension, when the existing
code need to be transformed to meet those needs. The "Code Owner" engineer may
dictate the specifics of how the code will be changed, but can only offer
suggestions regarding when, why, and to what end.

Code Stewardship lacks the bravado of Code Ownership, but is more accurate and
direct about the relationship between the engineer and the code. The engineer
will do his/her best to maintain and improve the code but understands that
ultimate authority over the code rests elsewhere. The engineer may share
stewardship with one or more others, and the time may come when the engineer
will need to give up stewardship.

This may not seem like much, but the way we speak about things has the ability
to influence the way we think about things.

If an engineering organization espouses Code Ownership in their recruitment and
motivational practices, how will the engineers take it when their proposals
are passed over, their deadlines are shortened, or their projects are
reprioritized?

If that same engineering organization has instead invested time evangelizing
Code Stewardship, how might the responses of their engineers be different when
faced with the same circumstances?
